![me]

I am a 29-year-old Computer Science (with Games Engineering) graduate from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.

I'm currently studying for a Postgraduate degree in [MSc Games Engineering](http://www.ncl.ac.uk/postgraduate/courses/degrees/computer-game-engineering-msc/) at [Newcastle University](http://www.ncl.ac.uk/).

I am a highly motivated and passionate programmer who loves a challenge, and I'm keen to join a vibrant team of like-minded individuals who can help me pursue my dream career of working on video games that people love to play.

I am currently looking for:
  * A placement opportunity to last between Easter and the end of August 2018, to gain valuable experience of working as a programmer within the games industry, and to work on a project to form the basis of my Masters degree project and thesis.
  * A permanent graduate position as a software engineer to fulfil upon completion of my degree towards the end of 2018.

My main interests include:
  * C++ programming
  * Graphics programming (experience using OpenGL)
  * Cross-platform development (including Windows, macOS, Linux and other unusual platforms)
  * DIY/hobbyist electronics projects (e.g. [OSSC](http://junkerhq.net/xrgb/index.php?title=OSSC))
  * Contributing to [open-source projects](http://github.com/milkytracker/milkytracker/)
  * Enjoying and restoring vintage computers (e.g. Commodore Amiga)

My current most-played games are:
  * Overwatch
  * Battlefield series
  * Fallout 4
