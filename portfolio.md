Here is a selection of my previous work and contributions related to graphics, physics, game engine, and other areas of programming.

### Stunt Track Racer (2017)

<div class="gallery">

</div>

Developed as part of the [Computer Games Development] module of my BSc. degree, this game was designed as a nod to the 1989 classic, [Stunt Car Racer](http://gamesnostalgia.com/en/game/stunt-track-racer) on the Amiga.

The objective is simple - complete the circuit by reaching all the checkpoints before the time runs out. If you fall off the track, you can reset to the previous checkpoint, __BUT__ it will cost you 10 seconds!
 
The game features:
  * A custom game engine written from scratch in C++.
  * Cross-platform support by using [SDL][sdl] and OpenGL.
  * Sophisticated vehicle physics using [Bullet][bullet].
  * Custom "zone"-based memory allocation and management (Ã  la the Doom and Quake engines).
  * Data-driven track, car, and asset loading by means of parsing [YAML](http://yaml.org/) (.yml) files.
  * Semi-automated track geometry generation by using control points loaded from data files to create [Catmull-Rom splines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centripetal_Catmull%E2%80%93Rom_spline).

### Screen-Space Ambient Occlusion (2017)

</div>

For my final year BSc dissertation project, I chose to implement an advanced graphics rendering technique called _Screen-Space Ambient Occlusion_, or SSAO. This technique allows one to add realtime soft shadows to a 3D scene as a fast post-processing stage within a deferred rendering pipeline.

The aim of the project was to evaluate the performance of the algorithm, both in terms of efficiency and visual appearance. The [Crytek Sponza](http://g3d.cs.williams.edu/g3d/data10/index.html) was chosen as a test scene, and a cross-platform engine was developed as a test bench for the algorithm. [SDL][sdl] was used to ease porting between Windows and Android.

The software project features:
  * A 4-stage deferred rendering pipeline for OpenGL 3.x and OpenGL ES 3.x.
  * Frames-per-second counter.
  * Configurable number of SSAO samples.
  * Ability to enable/disable blurring stage.
  * Ability to examine the "G-buffer" to visualise the different stages of the pipeline.

This project was very interesting as it gave me experience of leveraging framebuffer objects and "render-to-texture" to implement post-processing effects. It was also nice to see that SSAO is feasible on mobile GPUs in 2017; 10 years ago SSAO was just becoming a possibiliy on desktop PC GPUs.

## Contributions to other projects

### MilkyTracker (2014-present)

[![mt_thumb]][mt]{: .image-popup-no-margins }

[MilkyTracker] is a cross-platform music creation tool based around the [.XM (eXtended Module)] format. Developed as a clone of [FastTracker II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FastTracker_2) for MS-DOS, which gained popularity in the 1990s within the games industry and the [demoscene], MilkyTracker has become a go-to tool for musicians aiming to achieve a "retro" or "chiptune" sound.

My involvement with the project began in 2014, when I contributed a reworked port of the program for macOS based around modern APIs ("Cocoa"). Originally, MilkyTracker's Macintosh port was based around "Carbon", a depracated legacy compatibility layer intended as a stop-gap solution for bringing apps from MacOS 9.x to Mac OS X. A more modern port of MilkyTracker based around OpenGL and Cocoa meant that tighter integration with modern macOS features could be achieved.

I now make fairly regular contributions as co-maintainer of the project.

Some of my previous contributions include:
  * Replacing the old Automake build system with a new cross-platform CMake-based one.
  * Setting up [Travis] and [AppVeyor] continuous integration for the project to cover the three major ports (Windows, macOS, Linux).
  * Bugfixes to the Mac Core Audio sound driver.
  * Implementation of miscellaneous feature requests and addressing bug reports.
  * Reworking the old website to use GitHub Pages and Jekyll for easier maintenance.
