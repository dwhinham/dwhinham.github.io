Here is a selection of my previous work and contributions related to graphics, physics, game engine, and other areas of programming.

### Own projects

#### _Stunt Track Racer_ (2017)

Developed as part of the [_Computer Games Development_ module](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/module.php?code=CSC3224) of my BSc. degree, this game was designed as a nod to the 1989 classic, [_Stunt Car Racer_](http://gamesnostalgia.com/en/game/stunt-track-racer) on the Amiga.

The objective is simple - complete the circuit by reaching all the checkpoints before the time runs out. If you fall off the track, you can reset to the previous checkpoint, __BUT__ it will cost you 5 seconds!

The game features:
  * A custom game engine written from scratch in C++
  * Cross-platform support by using [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) and OpenGL.
  * Sophisticated vehicle physics using [Bullet](http://bulletphysics.org/)
  * Custom "zone"-based memory allocation and management (Ã  la the Doom and Quake engines)
  * Data-driven track, car, and asset loading by means of parsing [YAML](http://yaml.org/) (.yml) files
  * Semi-automated track geometry generation by using control points loaded from data files to create [_Catmull-Rom_ splines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centripetal_Catmull%E2%80%93Rom_spline)
