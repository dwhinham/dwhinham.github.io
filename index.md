![me]

Hello! I am a software engineer from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.

I hold a [Masters' degree in Computer Science (Games Engineering)](http://www.ncl.ac.uk/postgraduate/courses/degrees/computer-game-engineering-msc/) from [Newcastle University](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/).

I especially love electronics, music, embedded systems and programming; sometimes all mixed together.
I'm most well-known for [mt32-pi](https://github.com/dwhinham/mt32-pi), a bare-metal MIDI synthesizer for Raspberry Pi.

## Some of my interests include:
  * Low-level programming languages (C/C++, Rust)
  * Embedded systems programming (bare-metal Raspberry Pi, Arduino etc.)
  * Audio and graphics-related programming
  * Cross-platform development (including Windows, macOS, Linux and other unusual platforms)
  * 'Homebrew' software for games consoles (e.g. Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation Vita, and Nintendo Switch)
  * DIY/hobbyist electronics projects (e.g. [OSSC](http://junkerhq.net/xrgb/index.php?title=OSSC))
  * Contributing to [open-source projects](http://github.com/milkytracker/milkytracker/)
  * The [Demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene)
  * Enjoying and restoring vintage computers (e.g. Commodore Amiga)
