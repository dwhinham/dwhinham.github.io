![me]

I am a Computer Science (with Games Engineering) graduate from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.

I'm currently studying for a Postgraduate degree in [MSc Games Engineering](http://www.ncl.ac.uk/postgraduate/courses/degrees/computer-game-engineering-msc/) at [Newcastle University](http://www.ncl.ac.uk/).

In September 2018 I will be joining the [EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Cloud Computing for Big Data](http://www.bigdata-cdt.ac.uk/) as an MRes student, with the hope of progressing on to studying for a PhD in Computer Science.

## Some of my interests include:
  * Low-level programming languages (C/C++, Rust)
  * Graphics programming (experienced in OpenGL)
  * Cross-platform development (including Windows, macOS, Linux and other unusual platforms)
  * 'Homebrew' software for games consoles (e.g. Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation Vita, and Nintendo Switch)
  * DIY/hobbyist electronics projects (e.g. [OSSC](http://junkerhq.net/xrgb/index.php?title=OSSC))
  * Contributing to [open-source projects](http://github.com/milkytracker/milkytracker/)
  * Enjoying and restoring vintage computers (e.g. Commodore Amiga)
