![me]

I am an [MSc Games Engineering](http://www.ncl.ac.uk/postgraduate/courses/degrees/computer-game-engineering-msc/) graduate from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.

I'm currently studying for a PhD in Computer Science/Game Technology with [Dr. Graham Morgan](https://grahamiskind.github.io/home/) and the [EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Cloud Computing for Big Data](http://www.bigdata-cdt.ac.uk/) at [Newcastle University](http://www.ncl.ac.uk/).

My area of research focusses on distributed real-time physics simulations using cloud computing.

## Some of my interests include:
  * Low-level programming languages (C/C++, Rust)
  * Graphics programming (experienced in OpenGL)
  * Cross-platform development (including Windows, macOS, Linux and other unusual platforms)
  * 'Homebrew' software for games consoles (e.g. Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation Vita, and Nintendo Switch)
  * DIY/hobbyist electronics projects (e.g. [OSSC](http://junkerhq.net/xrgb/index.php?title=OSSC))
  * Contributing to [open-source projects](http://github.com/milkytracker/milkytracker/)
  * The [Demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene)
  * Enjoying and restoring vintage computers (e.g. Commodore Amiga)
